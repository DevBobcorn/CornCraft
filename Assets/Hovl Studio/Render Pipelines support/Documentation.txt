The editor replaces shaders in the materials to make effects work with different Rendering Pipelines.
Works only with Hovl Studio assets - https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/28391

Files with shaders are placed in the .unitypackages because without a pre-loaded RP they can cause errors!

Using: 
Go to tab "Tools > Pipeline changer for Hovl Studio assets"
After opening the window, select the desired Render Pipeline.


IMPORTANT! All shaders are oriented to work with Linear color space.
For Gamma color space follow instruction in the screenshot and change HDRP_Blend_TwoSides or LWRP_Blend_TwoSides shader (depending on your render pipeline).
