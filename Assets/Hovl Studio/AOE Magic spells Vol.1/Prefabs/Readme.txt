I recomend you to use post effect "bloom".
Video and screenshots of the effects were made using post effect "bloom".
Bloom from Package manager makes all scene unsaturated and faded: https://youtu.be/Ee8G4keWAlQ
so I recomend to use another free package: https://assetstore.unity.com/?q=Bloom&orderBy=0
I like this one: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/fastmobilebloom-79310
