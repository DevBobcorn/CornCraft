[v1.12.9]
Fixed: Fixed an issue in RestoreRotation in Algorithm 2 that caused an error when two particles overlapped at exactly the same coordinates.
Fixed: Fixed an issue where external forces such as wind would become weaker at lower framerates.

[v1.12.8]
Fixed: Fixed an issue that caused an error when removing a cloth component after adding a collider. This is a bug introduced in v1.12.7.

[v1.12.7]
Fixed: Fixed an error caused by turning off / on the cloth component active after removing the collider.

[v1.12.6]
Fixed: Fixed an issue that caused an error in Collections Package 1.3.0 and later.

[v1.12.5]
Note: MagicaCloth is now available in the 2D Animation Package.
Added: Added an option to the MagicaPhysicsManager component to change the location of simulation updates.
Normally, the simulation is run after the Late Update, but you can select Before Late Update to run it before the Late Update.
This is required when using 2D Animation Package etc.
Added: Added API to change Spring Power.
Added: Added API to get a list of all registered MagicaCloth components.
Improvement: In the Spring parameter inspector, numbers that cannot be changed during execution are grayed out and cannot be manipulated.

Note: The fast mesh write option [Faster Write] is turned off by default.
This is due to problems such as the mesh breaking depending on the environment.
We are currently investigating this matter.
Fixed: Fixed an issue where the mesh would break at run time if there was a difference between the SkinnedMeshRenderer scale and the rootBone scale when creating the RenderDeformer.
However, to solve this problem, you need to reconstruct the data by pressing the [Create] button of the corresponding Render Deformer.

This is available in the MagicaPhysicsManager's Faster Write option (default is ON)
By using this function, the speed of writing data to the mesh will be significantly increased.
However, this feature is only available on Unity 2021.2 and above.
