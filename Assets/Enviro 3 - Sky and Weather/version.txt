* Improved volumetric clouds blending. More improvements for this in next updates.
* Improved volumetric clouds detail rendering. 
* Fixed some artifacts with point and spot volumetric lights and fixed an issue with directional volumetrics are not blurred anymore. There will be more improvements in next updates!
