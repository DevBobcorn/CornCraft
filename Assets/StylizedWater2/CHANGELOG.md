- Sharp and Stream waves normal map.
- River mode, slope threshold parameter.

Changed:
- Updated smooth waves normal map to show less repetition.
- Alpha channels of deep/shallow colors no longer control opacity, but water depth instead. Clear water is now made possible.
- Simple shading now also masks out objects above the water for refraction.
- Advanced shading now also refracts the fog gradient (requires more calculations, hence limited to this mode).
- Reflections are now laid over translucency shading. Added a parameter to control this behaviour.
- Optimized wave shader calculations for vertex animations.
- Double-clicking a water mesh in an inspector now properly selects it, rather than the OS trying to open the file.

Fixed:
- Planar Reflection with Underwater Rendering causing a black/white image when used together.

- Support for spot/point light shadows in Unity 2021.1+/URP v12+ (requires the "Receive shadows" option to be enabled).

Changed:

- Lighting no longer applies to the reflected image, since it is already lit. Added parameter to control this behavior.
- Warning is now displayed in the material UI if the render queue set is illegal.

Fixed:
- Specular reflection for point lights still being calculated when Light Reflection feature was disabled.
- Shadow mask used for the sun reflection/translucency did not take shadow fading into account.

If in use, this version must be updated alongside of the Underwater Rendering extension v1.0.4.

Added:
- Support for lightmaps and realtime GI

Changed:
- Floating Transform component now has a "Dynamic material" checkbox. If set, wave settings are fetched each frame.
- Sample positions on Floating Transform component now correctly work with prefab overrides.
- Water Grid component will now regenerate the water tile mesh if it is missing. Allowing it to be used in prefabs.
- Intersection Foam and Edge Fade effects now fade out when the camera sits extremely close on the water surface (excluded for rivers).
  * This avoids them being visible through the waves, causing a horizontal line.
  * Can cause slight visual warping, but this isn't noticeable for animated water
- Green vertex color channel now controls the depth color gradient, rather than Opacity. This allows all depth-based effects to be controlled through vertex colors
* This behaviour still controls opacity when river mode is used.

Fixed:

- "Screen position out of view frustum" errors being thrown when using Planar Reflections with an orthographic camera aimed completely straight.

- Buoyancy.Raycast function. Given a position and direction, finds the intersection point with the water
- Planar Reflections, maximum LOD quality setting. Can be used to limit reflected objects to LOD1 or LOD2
- Caustics distortion parameter. Offsets the caustics based on the normal map.

Changed:
- Planar Reflections, standard fog no longer renders into to the reflection. This can cause artifacts where it "bleeds" over partially culled geometry

Changed:
- Material UI now has a help toggle button, with quick links to documentation
- Buoyancy.SampleWaves function now has a boolean argument, to indicate if the material's wave parameters are being changed at runtime. Version without this has been marked as obsolete.

- Distance fade parameter for waves. Waves can smoothly fade out between a start/end distance, to avoid tiling artifacts when viewed from afar.
- Planar Reflections, option to specify the renderer to be used for reflection. This allows a set up where certain render features aren't being applied to the reflection

Changed:
- Planar Reflections inspector now shows a warning and quick-fix button if the bounds need to be recalculated.

Added:
- Planar Reflections, option to include skybox.

Changed:
- Greatly improved caustics shading. No longer depends on the normal map for distortion.
- Normal map now has a speed multiplier, rather than being bound to the wave animation speed. If any custom materials were made, these likely have to be adjusted
- Updated default filepath for Boxophobic's Atmospheric Height Fog. This requires to reconfigure the fog integration through the Help window.
- Removed "MainColor" attribute from shader's deep color, to avoid Unity giving it a white color value for new materials
- Floating Transform, if roll strength is 0, the component will no longer modify the transform's orientation

- Planar Reflections render scale now takes render scale configured in URP settings into account
- Improved Rough Waves and Sea Foam textures
